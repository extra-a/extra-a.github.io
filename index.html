				<p>
					This client is based on pisto's work of porting the Sauerbraten client from SDL 1.2 to SDL 2, which should give overall better performance. It offers the same features as pisto's <a href="https://github.com/pisto/sdos-test">sdos-test client</a>, except for the multipoll functionality. Multipoll aims to minimize the input lag, and as a result, it is less constant and thus (for some people) hard to get used to.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, this client uses old school polling at regular intervals in order to keep the inevitable input lag constant, which should make it easier for players to get used to the (still small) input lag. At least that's the theory. Note that as a result of this, the input polling rate is linked to your fps count, so keep this in mind when enabling vsync. A tried and tested technique is to set maxfps to the highest multiple of your screen's refresh rate (if you are unsure, it's most likely 60Hz) you can reliably achieve.
