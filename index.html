				<p>
					This client is based on pisto's work of porting the Sauerbraten client from SDL 1.2 to SDL 2, which should give better mouse input in some cases. It offers the same features as pisto's <a href="https://github.com/pisto/sdos-test">sdos-test client</a>, except for the multipoll functionality. Multipoll aims to minimize the input lag, and as a result, it is less constant and thus (for some people) hard to get used to. So instad using high maxfps values like 250/500/1000 will reduce sceen tearing, without any possible vsync lags.<span style="color: #f00;"> Note: if you still have performance issues try to set "/maxfps 0". <span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Visual studio and official sld2 libriries for windows are used. Combined with replacing multipoll by the old and tested sauerbraten code, this will result in better performance and compatibility with more OS/hardware combinations. Also some additional visual options, that have been missing for years are provided (all of them are diabled by default and separate config files are used).
